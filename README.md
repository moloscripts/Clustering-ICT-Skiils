# R- Implementation of Clustering using K-Prototypes algorithm

K-Prototypes is a combination of K-means and K-modes. This project used K-prototypes, found in the [clustMixType package](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-048/RJ-2018-048.pdf) to cluster a data set with 73% numerical variables and 27% of categorical variables. 

* Interpretation of the clusters is done by visualising the clusters using `cprofiles()`. 

* Performance comparison of the two clustering algorithms is measured using the [rand index](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/fossil/html/rand.index.html)
